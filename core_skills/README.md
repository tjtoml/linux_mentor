===================
This section will focus on familiarizing the complete neophyte with the linux operating system, the basics of using a terminal emulator, ssh, and virtualization. After completing this section, you should be prepared to provision a new VM (either locally or via a cloud-hosting service) and follow along in a tutorial.

##Creating a Local Work Environment
The first thing any linux administrator needs is an environment designed to interact with the servers he administers. Strictly speaking, one can get by with a SSH client like [PuTTy](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) that provides a console connection to a remote server, but I believe that the best way to learn is by immersion. Specifically, I think you should administer linux servers from a linux operating system. This can be accomplished in two ways: you can either install a linux distribution to your local hard drive, or you can create a Virtual Machine (VM). I am not prepared to give up essential programs that are Windows only, so I elected to use the Virtual Machine approach. 

To get started, [install VirtualBox and create a VM.](https://github.com/tjtoml/linux_mentor/blob/master/core_skills/create_local_vm.md) 

Once that is done, [install Ubuntu 14.04 on your new VM](https://github.com/tjtoml/linux_mentor/blob/master/core_skills/install_ubuntu.md).
