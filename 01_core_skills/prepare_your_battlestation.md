# Prepare Your Battlestation
The first thing any linux administrator needs is an environment designed to interact with the servers he administers. Strictly speaking, one can get by with a SSH client like [PuTTy](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html) that provides a console connection to a remote server, but I believe that the best way to learn is by immersion. Specifically, I think you should administer linux servers from a linux operating system. Why?

 * You can write and test scripts on a local system
 * Key utilities are already included (a decent terminal emulator, especially)
 * You can run software on your local machine that interacts with remote systems natively
 * Superior package management compared to Mac or Windows

This can be accomplished in two ways: you can either install a linux distribution to your local hard drive, or you can create a Virtual Machine (VM). I am not prepared to give up essential programs that are Windows only, so I elected to use the Virtual Machine approach.

No matter which one of these you select, from here on out, we will assume that you are using a linux distribution as your local OS to interact with your servers.
